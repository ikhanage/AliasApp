For the record I wanted to go back to Kennington and have lunch at Oaka.

I thought it would be really cute to go back to where we had our first date and reminisce.  To think back about the last year we've been together from the place where it officially started.

But no, you didn't want to go back.  So that plan went down the poopenheimer.

We could have seen the red elephant again!  I bet he's been wondering how it all went.  Poor elephant.  I'll drop him a text...

But anywhale, LUNCHTIME!
