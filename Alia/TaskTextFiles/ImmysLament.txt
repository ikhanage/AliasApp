I wander lost and lonely,
Through darkness trying to find my way,
Many have trod this path before me,
But far too few avail.

Am I to come up empty handed,
After putting my thoughts to this alone?
Putting off all these big decisions,
Wondering to where the time has flown.

I am here, find me,
Find me before the sun truly sets,
Wrap me up, keep me warm
From the cold of my regrets.
