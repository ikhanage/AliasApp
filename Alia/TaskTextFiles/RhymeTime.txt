We two are a silly duo,
But we differ only slightly.
They see us and say I'm a clown,
With his girl who shines sso brightly.

We set a path across a city,
To see where we may land,
The clown tries to please the lady,
As they go through what is planned.

Will this clown be proved a prince?
Can this day be filled with laughter?
Maybe the lady will be unamused by this,
Or maybe they'll live happily ever after.
