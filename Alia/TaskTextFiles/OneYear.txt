O-M-G! This is so totally not lumpy!

It's been one whole year since we've been together!  That's like eating a pie, not a slice of pie, the whole thing! 

Have you ever eaten a whole pie? It starts of great.  You think "Yum! Check out this crust.” Then you get to the gooey sweet centre, “Wow! What a treat for my taste buds!”.

But then things go bad, “I’m getting full.” you think or “The sugar is making me queasy”.  You may start to question you sanity “Was this crust’s deliciousness all a bitter lie?”.

But being with you is like eating a pie that never makes you ill. You’ve definitely got a sweet filling but you’re not making wish I hadn’t eaten so much of you.

This analogy has probably gone too far.  Basically I’m just trying to say that I like your crust ;)
