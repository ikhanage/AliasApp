So my little crusty pie, you must be wondering what I’ve got planned today.

Well, I’ve have put on a little game for us to play.  We’re going to wander around London. Do London things: Ride the tube, Get lost on the Northern Line, Be rude to a stranger etc. And along the way this app will give you some things to read and some quizzes to play.

It’ll be fun. I hope! I was hoping this would be a cool way to spend our anniversary. I know you’ve been super busy, so this is our time to relax. And hunt down the clues!

Also if you finish the quest you will earn a prize.  No one knows what the prize is. Some say it’s a Kinder Egg.  Others also say it’s a Kinder Egg.  But only completing the quest will allow you to gain the Kinder Egg and be sure that the Kinder Egg is a Kinder Egg.

(It may be a kinder Egg)
